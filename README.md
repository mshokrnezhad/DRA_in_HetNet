A Distributed Heuristic Approach to Allocate Resources in Heterogeneous Networks
- BS_assignment.cpp: Assigning each node to its nearest BS
- node_generator.cpp: Generating nodes
- resource_allocation_IR.cpp: Assigning frequency channels (not shared between nodes of different BSs) using the second-price auction and controlling transmit powers using the non-cooprating game
- resource_allocation_SR.cpp: Assigning frequency channels (shared between nodes of different BSs) using the second-price auction and controlling transmit powers using the non-cooprating game
- script_ng.sh: Generating different Heterogeneous networks
- script_ra.sh:Allocating resources for different Heterogeneous networks
